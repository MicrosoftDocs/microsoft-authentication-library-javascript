# Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (MSAL.js)

The Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript enables both client-side and server-side JavaScript applications to authenticate users using [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview) for work and school accounts, Microsoft personal accounts (MSA), and social identity providers like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft accounts, etc. through [Azure AD B2C](/../../azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview#identity-providers) service. It also enables your app to get tokens to access [Microsoft Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/enterprise) services such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).

## Core and wrapper libraries

The [`lib`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib) folder contains the source code for MSAL.js libraries in active development. You'll also find all the details about **installing the libraries** in their respective README.md files.

-   [Microsoft Authentication Library for Node.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node/): A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library that enables authentication and token acquisition with the Microsoft Identity platform in JavaScript applications. Implements the following OAuth 2.0 protocols and is [OpenID-compliant](/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc):

    -   [Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) with [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)
    -   [Device Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/device-code/)
    -   [Refresh Token Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)
    -   [Client Credential Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/)
    -   [Silent Flow](/entra/identity-platform/msal-acquire-cache-tokens#acquiring-tokens-silently-from-the-cache)
    -   [On-behalf-of Flow](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow)

-   [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-browser/): A browser-based, framework-agnostic browser library that enables authentication and token acquisition with the Microsoft Identity platform in JavaScript applications. Implements the OAuth 2.0 [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow), and is [OpenID-compliant](/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc).

-   **[Native authentication](/entra/identity-platform/concept-native-authentication) support in MSAL**: MSAL JS provides native authentication APIs that allow applications to implement a native experience with end-to-end customizable flows in their web applications. With native authentication, user can fully customize the user interface, including design elements, logo placement, and layout, ensuring a consistent and branded look.The native authentication feature is available for SPAs on [External ID for customers](/entra/identity-platform/concept-native-authentication)

-   [Microsoft Authentication Library for React](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-react/): A wrapper of the msal-browser library for apps using React.

-   [Microsoft Authentication Library for Angular](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular/): A wrapper of the msal-browser library for apps using Angular framework.

-   [Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Node](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/extensions/msal-node-extensions/): The Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Node offers secure mechanisms for client applications to perform cross-platform token cache serialization and persistence. It gives additional support to the Microsoft Authentication Library for Node (MSAL).

### Libraries in Long-term Support (LTS)

The following libraries, hosted on the `msal-lts` branch, are no longer in active development, but they are still receiving critical security bug fix support.

-   [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript v2.x](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/msal-lts/lib/msal-browser)
-   [Microsoft Authentication Library for Node.js v1.x](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/msal-lts/lib/msal-node)
-   [Microsoft Authentication Library for React v1.x](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/msal-lts/lib/msal-react)
-   [Microsoft Authentication Library for Angular v2.x](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/msal-lts/lib/msal-angular)

## Package structure

There are a number of different packages meant for different platforms. You can see the relationship between packages and different authentication flows they implement in the package structure below.

## Samples

The [`code samples`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples) demonstrate usage of the Microsoft authentication libraries for JavaScript with the identity platform. Each code sample includes a `README.md` file describing how to build the project (if applicable) and run the sample application. 

For a complete list of samples targeting JavaScript and other languages, frameworks, and platforms, please refer to the [Microsoft identity platform code samples](/entra/identity-platform/sample-v2-code).

For native authentication features, the [sample apps](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-native-javascript-samples/tree/main/typescript/native-auth) demonstrate how to use native authentication in React and Angular web applications. Each code sample includes a `README.md` file describing how to build the project and run the sample application. Current native authentication API doesn't support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), the sample app will run using local proxy.

## Package versioning

All of our libraries follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). We recommend using the latest version of each library to ensure you have the latest security patches and bug fixes.

## Security reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services [please report it to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://aka.ms/report-security-issue) with as much detail as possible.
